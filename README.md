# AestheticAPI
A webservice that converts text to ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ full-width UNICODE notably, among other actions. Target implementation is a Slack integration.

The AestheticAPI, a reference to the vaporwave culture's obsession with ｒａｄｉｃａｌ and ｇｎａｒｌｙ neo-retro 80s/90s ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ, seeks to fill a niche of manipulating text via a web API in cases where a custom code or library cannot be inserted natively to acheive the same result. (i.e Slack)
